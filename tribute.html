        <p>Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family with roots in Uttarakhand. He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.</p>
        <p>Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team, but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team. His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.</p>
        <p>He married Sakshi Singh Rawat on 4 July 2010.Dhoni and his wife have one daughter.</p>
        <p>From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal</p>

        <center><h2>Playing style</h2></center>
        <p>Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. He is an unorthodox batsman, in the sense that much of his batting technique does not follow coaching manuals. He prefers to hit a full ball to Long-on, Long-off or Midwicket regions rather than driving it to the Cover region. </p>
        <p> He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.He made use of the helicopter shot technique, taught to him by a fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.</p>
        <p>His wicket-keeping skill is widely praised by cricket experts but also criticised for lack of good technique. He has a world record for the highest number of stumpings by any wicket-keeper.</p>
